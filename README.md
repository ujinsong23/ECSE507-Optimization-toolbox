_The project took place in Jan - Apr 2022._
# ECSE507-Optimization-toolbox
Build user-friendly optimization toolbox for solving general constrained/unconstrained optimization problems



The directory of uploaded files is as follows:

1. `Software documentation.mlx`: This MATLAB Live Editor file provides a description of the program's functions, all required arguments for each function, and an example of how to run the program, facilitating deployment for less experienced users.

2. `Solutions.mlx`: This MATLAB Live Editor file delves into the solutions for the given problems, accompanied by detailed graphs illustrating the convergence to the minimum.

3. `Functions` folder: Contains nine functions essential for running the MATLAB Live Editor files (.mlx).
   - `myGrad.m` : finding gradient at given point
   - `sgd2d.m` : SGD algorithm for 2d functions
